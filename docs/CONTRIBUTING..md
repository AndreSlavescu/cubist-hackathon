# Contributing to the Project

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of this repository.
2. **Clone your fork**: Find the 'Clone' option in your forked repository and copy the URL. Then run `git clone <URL>` in your terminal to get a local copy of the code.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**: Before making your changes, switch to a new branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
2. **Make your changes**: Update or add files as necessary. Please keep your code clean and well-commented.
3. **Test your changes**: Make sure your changes do not break the project. Run any existing tests, and consider writing new ones if you're adding functionality.
4. **Commit your changes**: Once you're happy with your changes, add them to the branch with `git add .` and commit them with `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your fork with `git push origin <branch-name>`.
2. **Open a pull request**: Go to the original repository, and you should see a prompt to open a pull request. Click 'Compare & pull request', then submit it with a clear title and description.
3. **Request a review**: Request a review from the project maintainers. Address any feedback they provide.

## Code Review

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They might suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives. Some things to remember:

- Keep your pull requests small and focused; they should include only one feature or fix at a time.
- Write a clear message for commit and pull request. Include the purpose of your change and how it was implemented.
- Follow the coding style and guidelines of the project.

## After your pull request is merged

Once your pull request is merged, you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

Congratulations! You've successfully contributed to the project.
